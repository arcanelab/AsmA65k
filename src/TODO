- Verify that each regex is case insensitive

During assembly of a line, the following steps must be done:

T0. Compose InstructionWord:

struct InstructionWord
{
    byte registerConfiguration: 4;
    byte addressingMode: 4;
    byte opcodeSize: 2;             // assigned by AsmA65k::assembleInstruction()
    byte instructionCode: 6;        // assigned by AsmA65k::assembleInstruction()
};

T1. every handleOpcode[XYZ]() must fill in the rest:
    - addressingMode
    - registerConfiguration

T2. Add finished InstructionWord to the machine code
T3. Add additional registerConfiguration byte (optional)
T4. Add other operands to the machine code (optional)
